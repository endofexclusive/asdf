nano startup for small applications.


# BUILD

# MISC
GCC register variable can be used for referencing Amiga custom registers. See
how the preprocessor symbol CUSTOM_AS_GLOBAL_REG is used.

Custom inline functions are used calling AmigaOS library routines (xproto.h).

GCC option -mshort used to enable 16-bit integers (instead of 32-bit which is
default).

Annotated disassembly is generated in the .s files.

The code for taking over the system is probably not complete and correct.
Please improve :-).
